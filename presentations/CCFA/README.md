# The Rise of Decentralized Finance
Exploring the Transformation of Financial Markets With Decentralized Finance and Digital Asset Protocols

## Abstract

In this webinar, [Alan Wunsche](https://github.com/alanwunsche/bio), CEO of TokenFunder and TokenGX -- Canada's first regulated digital securities investing and trading platform -- will introduce the latest applications of blockchain-powered DeFi (Decentralized Finance) protocols across the globe, and look ahead to their potential impacts on traditional financial services (now known as CeFi - Centralized Finance).

The presentation will review the importance of blockchain-native stablecoins, decentralized cryptocurrency trading and security tokens. Participants will also have the opportunity to explore and discuss the transformative impact of open source, blockchain "money market protocols" that are already establishing global liquidity pools for collateralized digital asset borrowing, lending and "yield farming" services that currently operate outside of the traditional financial system infrastructure.
