## What is fDAI, fUSDC, fWBTC?
fDAI, fUSDC, fWBTC are the yield-bearing versions of these assets, which are being automatically farmed by the harvest algorithm.
These assets are automatically appreciating, and you can redeem them at any time for DAI, USDC, wBTC.

## What was the reason for launching Harvest?
We were looking for a convenient way to farm the latest projects that were producing different reward tokens. The process was highly manual and inconvenient for people that had a normal job and didnâ€™t want to keep up with DeFi 24/7.
Gas prices have been really high, and it was expensive to farm by ourselves, so we pooled our funds together to try to save on gas. We decided to build the solution that we were looking for ourselves, and hopefully will help many others.

## What is the road map for Harvest?
Yield farming is not going away, and gas prices are not getting lower. Our goal is to simply provide an easy way for people to benefit, and make your hard work much easier, while looking for safe projects to add to the farming repertoire.
We plan to add more assets over time. DAO funds can be used to add useful integrations, provide bug bounties and pay for security audits, and even fund projects to build on top of Harvest and add value to FARM holders.
